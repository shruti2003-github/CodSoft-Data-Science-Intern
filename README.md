# CODSOFT INTERN (DATA SCIENCE)
PROJECT-1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PROJECT

This project focuses on predicting the survival likelihood of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and embarkation point. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes historical data to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. The goal is to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates and to build a predictive model that can generalize to unseen data. The Titanic Survival Prediction project provides an opportunity to explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques to predictive model for survival on a historical context.
