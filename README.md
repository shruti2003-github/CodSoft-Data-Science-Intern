# CODSOFT INTERN (DATA SCIENCE)
PROJECT-1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PROJECT

This project focuses on predicting the survival likelihood of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and embarkation point. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes historical data to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. The goal is to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates and to build a predictive model that can generalize to unseen data. The Titanic Survival Prediction project provides an opportunity to explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques to predictive model for survival on a historical context.

PROJECT-2 : SALES PREDICTION

This project goal is leveraging features such as 'TV,' 'Radio,' and 'Newspaper' to predict 'Sales.' Also, understanding the dynamics that drive sales is crucial for strategic decision-making. By analyzing the relationships between advertising channels and sales outcomes, our goal is to develop a predictive model that provides actionable insights for optimizing advertising budgets and maximizing sales performance.

PROJECT-3 : CREDIT CARD FROUD DETECTION

In our project, we employ Machine Learning to combat the rising threat of credit card fraud. Focused on developing a predictive model, we leverage historical transaction data and advanced algorithms, particularly decision tree-based models like Random Forests. Our goal is to create an adaptive system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions, addressing challenges in imbalanced datasets and achieving a balance between precision and recall. Join us in this endeavor to enhance security, reduce financial losses, and fortify the integrity of electronic transactions.
